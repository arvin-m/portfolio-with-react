I was born in a small town named,Baneh, just west of Iran. In 2007, I graduated with an associate degree for computer software. At the end of 2016, I had the opportunity to move to the United States. With a fresh start and a new life with my family, I took my first job at an electrical company. With no experience. Every day I pushed myself to learn something new and excel at what I was doing. It was interesting and a very great experience, but I wasn\\u2019t happy. Like everyone, I had an American dream that I had envisioned for myself. My dream was to be a developer. For a short time, I decided to go back to school and get a college degree.That period of my life was very busy due to raising my two kids and maintaining a job at the same time. Not being able to manage everything, I had to drop out after my first semester. Though I quit, I thought about my dream every day and I was still determined. Learning code and being a developer wasn\\u2019t just going to be my \\u201Cdream\\u201D anymore, it was going to become my plan ! For me to be able have a better life for my family and myself and to be happy, I had to complete that missing of my life. I have finally gotten back on track !  I have managed the time and resources to study as a Full Stack Web Developer at Georgia Tech Bootcamp. Life couldn\\u2019t be better at the moment. I have a great family and pursuing a discipline that I\\u2019m very passionate about. These days, I keep a focused attitude and determination in all aspects in my life. Not only do I like to push myself mentally, but also, physically! My favorite time is when I\\u2019m in the gym. I love to work out!
