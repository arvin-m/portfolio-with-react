                    My name is Arvin. I was born in a small town named,Baneh, just west of Iran.
                    In 2007, I graduated with an associate degree for computer software.
                    At the end of 2016, I had the opportunity to move to the United States.
                    With a fresh start and a new life with my family, I took my first job at an electrical
                    company. With no experience. Every day I pushed myself to learn something new and excel
                    at what I was doing. It was interesting and a very great experience, but I wasn’t happy.
                    Like everyone, I had an American dream that I had envisioned for myself. My dream was to be a developer.
                    For a short time, I decided to go back to school and get a college degree.That period of my life was very
                    busy due to raising my two kids and maintaining a job at the same time. Not being able to manage
                    everything, I had to drop out after my first semester. Though I quit, I thought about my dream every day and I
                    was still determined. Learning code and being a developer
                    wasn’t just going to be my “dream” anymore, it was going to become my plan ! For me to
                    be able have a better life for my family and myself and to be happy, I had to complete
                    that missing of my life. I have finally gotten back on track ! I have managed
                    the time and resources to study as a Full Stack Web Developer at Georgia Tech Bootcamp. Life
                    couldn’t be better at the moment. I have a great family and pursuing a discipline that I’m
                    very passionate about. These days, I keep a focused attitude and determination in all
                    aspects in my life. Not only do I like to push myself mentally, but also, physically! My
                    favorite time is when I’m in the gym. I love to work out ! And like everyone, Music to top it off !
